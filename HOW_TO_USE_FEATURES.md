- ✅ Don't be in an input field or form
- ✅ Refresh the page and try again

### "I can't drag the clock!"
- ✅ Make sure you're on the watch page
- ✅ Try hovering over it - cursor should change to "grab"
- ✅ Click and hold, then drag

### "I can't edit the ticker label!"
- ✅ **Double-click** (not single click) on the white "BREAKING" box
- ✅ Don't click the ticker bar itself (that changes color)
- ✅ Click specifically on the label text

### "The @ key doesn't work for social badges!"
- ✅ Try **Shift + 2** instead (depending on keyboard layout)
- ✅ Or use **Ctrl + @** to open the editor directly
