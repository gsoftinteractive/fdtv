# FDTV Coin System - Client Brief

Dear Client,

Your FDTV platform now uses a **coin-based payment system** instead of monthly subscriptions. Here's everything you need to know:

---

## 🎯 How New Stations Are Created

**It's now much simpler:**

1. User signs up on your platform
2. **Automatically receives 1,000 starter coins** (free welcome gift)
3. Creates their station immediately - no waiting, no activation fee
4. Starts uploading videos and broadcasting right away
5. Buys more coins when needed

**No more:**
- ❌ ₦40,000 activation payment
- ❌ Waiting for admin approval
- ❌ "Pending" status holding them back

**Result:** Lower barrier to entry = More users signing up!

---

## 💰 How Coins Are Calculated & Used

Your users' coins are deducted based on **actual platform usage**:

### 1️⃣ Video Uploads
- **10 coins** per video uploaded
- **Example**: Upload 50 videos = 500 coins

### 2️⃣ Storage (Monthly)
- **50 coins per GB** per month
- **Example**:
  - 5GB of videos = 250 coins/month
  - 10GB of videos = 500 coins/month
  - 20GB of videos = 1,000 coins/month

### 3️⃣ Streaming (Real-time)
- **5 coins per hour** of streaming
- **Example**:
  - 100 hours streaming = 500 coins
  - 200 hours streaming = 1,000 coins

### 4️⃣ Monthly Maintenance
- **100 coins** per month (fixed)
- Covers server costs, platform upkeep

## ✅ Why This System Is Better

### Old Subscription Model
- Everyone paid ₦40,000/month
- Light users overpaid (used ₦5,000 worth, paid ₦40,000)
- Heavy barrier to entry
- Many potential users couldn't afford it

### New Coin Model
- Pay only for actual usage
- Small stations pay ~₦8,000-15,000/month
- Medium stations pay ~₦25,000/month
- Large stations pay ~₦50,000/month
- **Everyone pays fairly!**

### Business Benefits
✅ **More users sign up** (1,000 free coins to start)
✅ **Less complaints** (fair pricing)
✅ **Better retention** (users don't feel cheated)
✅ **Higher satisfaction** (transparent costs)

## 🎁 The 1,000 Starter Coins Strategy

**Why give 1,000 free coins?**

It lets new users:
- Test the full platform without paying first
- Upload 100 videos to get started
- Run their station for 1-2 months (light usage)
- Experience everything before buying

**Psychology:**
- Users get invested in the platform
- They build content library
- When coins run out, they're already committed
- Much higher conversion rate!

**Cost to you:** Minimal - just server resources for 1-2 months
**Benefit:** More users signing up and eventually buying coins

---

## 📈 What Happens When Coins Run Out?

**User Experience:**
1. See warnings when balance is low (<200, <100 coins)
2. At 0 coins:
   - ❌ Cannot upload new videos
   - ✅ Existing videos keep playing
   - ✅ Station stays live
   - ✅ Account stays active

3. User buys more coins via bank transfer
4. Admin approves payment
5. Coins credited immediately
6. User resumes full access

**It's gentle - no harsh suspension, just feature limitation.**

---

## 👨‍💼 Your Admin Controls

You can:
- ✅ See all users' coin balances
- ✅ Manually add/remove coins (with reason tracking)
- ✅ View complete transaction history
- ✅ Change coin pricing anytime
- ✅ Approve coin purchase payments
- ✅ Track every single coin movement

**Full transparency and control!**

## 🎯 Bottom Line

### Old Way
User pays ₦40,000/month regardless of usage → Many can't afford → Low signups

### New Way
User gets 1,000 free coins → Tests platform → Uses what they need → Pays fairly → More signups, happier users

**Your revenue potential actually increases** because:
- More users sign up (low barrier)
- Light users don't quit (fair pricing)
- Heavy users pay more (fair usage-based)
- Everyone feels they're getting value
