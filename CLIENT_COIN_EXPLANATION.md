# FDTV Coin System - Client Brief

Dear Client,

Your FDTV platform now uses a **coin-based payment system** instead of monthly subscriptions. Here's everything you need to know:

---

## 🎯 How New Stations Are Created

**The new process:**

1. User signs up on your platform (instant, no payment yet)
2. **User purchases coin package** via bank transfer (starting from ₦5,000)
3. Admin approves payment and credits coins to user's account
4. **User creates their station** (costs 100 coins - one-time fee)
5. User starts uploading videos and broadcasting
6. Buys more coins when needed

**No more:**
- ❌ ₦40,000 fixed monthly subscription
- ❌ Overpaying for unused resources
- ❌ "Pending" status waiting for approval

**Result:** Fair pricing + Lower entry cost = More users can afford to start!

---

## 💰 How Coins Are Calculated & Used

Your users' coins are deducted based on **actual platform usage**:

### 1️⃣ Station Creation
- **100 coins** (one-time fee)
- **Example**: Create 1 TV/Radio station = 100 coins (only once)

### 2️⃣ Video Uploads
- **10 coins** per video uploaded
- **Example**: Upload 50 videos = 500 coins

### 3️⃣ Storage (Monthly)
- **50 coins per GB** per month
- **Example**:
  - 5GB of videos = 250 coins/month
  - 10GB of videos = 500 coins/month
  - 20GB of videos = 1,000 coins/month

### 4️⃣ Streaming (Real-time)
- **5 coins per hour** of streaming
- **Example**:
  - 100 hours streaming = 500 coins
  - 200 hours streaming = 1,000 coins

### 5️⃣ Monthly Maintenance
- **100 coins** per month (fixed)
- Covers server costs, platform upkeep

## ✅ Why This System Is Better

### Old Subscription Model
- Everyone paid ₦40,000/month
- Light users overpaid (used ₦5,000 worth, paid ₦40,000)
- Heavy barrier to entry
- Many potential users couldn't afford it

### New Coin Model
- Pay only for actual usage
- Small stations pay ~₦8,000-15,000/month
- Medium stations pay ~₦25,000/month
- Large stations pay ~₦50,000/month
- **Everyone pays fairly!**

### Business Benefits
✅ **More users sign up** (1,000 free coins to start)
✅ **Less complaints** (fair pricing)
✅ **Better retention** (users don't feel cheated)
✅ **Higher satisfaction** (transparent costs)

## 📈 What Happens When Coins Run Out?

**User Experience:**
1. See warnings when balance is low (<200, <100 coins)
2. At 0 coins:
   - ❌ Cannot upload new videos
   - ✅ Existing videos keep playing
   - ✅ Station stays live
   - ✅ Account stays active

3. User buys more coins via bank transfer
4. Admin approves payment
5. Coins credited immediately
6. User resumes full access

**It's gentle - no harsh suspension, just feature limitation.**

---

## 👨‍💼 Your Admin Controls

You can:
- ✅ See all users' coin balances
- ✅ Manually add/remove coins (with reason tracking)
- ✅ View complete transaction history
- ✅ Change coin pricing anytime
- ✅ Approve coin purchase payments
- ✅ Track every single coin movement

**Full transparency and control!**

## 🎯 Bottom Line

### Old Way
User pays ₦40,000/month regardless of usage → Many can't afford → Low signups → Unhappy users

### New Way
User buys coins as needed → Pays only for what they use → Flexible top-ups → Fair pricing → More signups, happier users

**Your revenue potential actually increases** because:
- More users can afford to start (packages from ₦5,000)
- Light users don't quit (fair pricing, no overpaying)
- Medium users pay appropriately (₦10,000-25,000/month)
- Heavy users pay more (fair usage-based pricing)
- Everyone feels they're getting value
- Users only pay for actual resources consumed
